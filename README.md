## Overview
This project aims to explore, understand, and analyze traffic collisions in California. It delves into various aspects like factors contributing to collisions, time-series trends, and geospatial hotspots. The data is organized in SQLite tables such as `case_ids`, `collisions`, `victims`, and `parties`, providing a comprehensive view of traffic incidents.

## Data Source
The dataset is sourced from [California Traffic Collision Data from SWITRS](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexgude/california-traffic-collision-data-from-switrs). It comprises tables like `case_ids`, `collisions`, `victims`, and `parties`, each contributing unique features for the analysis.
